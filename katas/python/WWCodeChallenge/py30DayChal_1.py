# day 1: Create a program that swaps the values of two variables.
# value1 = input("Set value 1 (eg a name): ")
# print("Value 1 = " + value1)
# value2 = input("Set value 2 (eg a name): ")
# print("Value 2 = " + value2)
# value1, value2 = value2, value1
# print("Switch values 1 and 2: This is value 1 - " + value1 + ", and this is value 2 - " + value2)

# day 2: a program to calculate the area of a circle given its radius.
# radius = int(input("Enter radius: "))
# def calcCircleArea(radius):
#     area = radius * 3.14
#     return area
# print(calcCircleArea(radius))

# day 3: Write a function to count the number of vowels in a given string
# myString = input("Enter name: ")
# def getVowelCount(myString):
#     count = 0
#     for x in myString:
#         if x == 'a' or x == 'e' or x == 'i' or x == 'o' or x == 'u':
#             count += 1
#     return count
# print(getVowelCount(myString))

# day 4: Write a program to find the sum of all elements in a list.
mylist = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry"]
sum = 0
for x in mylist:
    sum += 1
print(sum)

# day 5: Write a program to count the occurrences of a specific character in a string.
myString = "appleorangecherry"
count = 0
for x in myString:
    if x == "r":
        count += 1
print(count)
